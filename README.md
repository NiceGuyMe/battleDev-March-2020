Objective

You are in charge of carrying out an exciting marketing study on the packaging of a new organic yogurt from short circuits. Even if you regret seeing a "responsible" brand draw inspiration from the methods of industrial producers, it's your job and you have no choice... You receive the results of a study where consumers indicate the color which they prefer for packaging. Not wanting to make such an important decision on your own, you want to present the 2 most requested colors to your boss.

Lines 2 through N +1: A string of between 4 and 10 lowercase alphabetic characters corresponding to the preferred color for packaging for a given person.

Exit
